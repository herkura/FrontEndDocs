    <title>Tags such as img, anchor, div</title>

  <body>
    <h1>This is an example of some html tags which we tend to use daily.</h1>
    <h2>First, I will be discussing the div tag.</h2> 
    <div class="aboutDiv">
      <p>Well, it is strange that I will be explaing the div tag inside the div tag.</br> 
     Divs are simply content division. It acts as a container and has no effect on content unless it is styled by CSS.</p>
   </div>
  <div class="aboutAnchor">
    <p>The anchor tag is used for linking one html page to other.</br> <pre> The anchor tag looks like this: <a href="">Text to display on the page</a> </pre></p>
  </div>
  <div class="aboutImg">
    <p>To represent images on a webpage or a website.</br> <pre> The image tag looks like this: <img src="" alt="about image"/></pre> 
    </br> The 'alt' in the img tag is not visible on the html page but it read by the screan readers and other assistive technology.</br> 
    within the img tag we can also add the width and height. <pre> For eg: <img src="" alt="void" width="100px" height="100px"/> </pre>
    </p>
  </div>
